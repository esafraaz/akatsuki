            <p>
                Konan is an anti-villain.Much like her partner, Nagato, Konan is very stoic, calm, and level-headed. She was much more cheerful as child before traumatic events led her to become a very serious person. She is very taciturn never spoke during Akatsuki meetings. She does seem to be more empathetic than most other Akatsuki members, as she appears sad whenever she has been reminded of her past, and was concerned with the safety of her teammates. She is also very loyal to Pain, having complete faith in him and doing his bidding without question.
